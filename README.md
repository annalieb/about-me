## My personal website

I'm Anna, a student at Wellesley College studying computer science and political science.

This repo contains my personal website, which summarizes the development
and design work I've done in the past few years. 
I coded this static site "from scratch" in HTML and CSS. :)

Email me at al117@wellesley.edu or visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-lieb/) for more information.

Thanks for visiting!
