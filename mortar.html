    <h3>MORTAR Web Design Project</h3>
    <h4>June-October 2021</h4>
    <p>As a Web Designer for <span>Develop for Good</span>, I was part of a volunteer
      team that conducted <span>UX design research</span> for nonprofit organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our nonprofit client was <a href="https://wearemortar.com/" target="_blank">MORTAR</a>,
      an entrepreneurship education program based in Cincinnati. The program aims
      to <span>empower historically marginalized entrepreneurs</span> to
      access the resources needed to start & run successful businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      As web designers, our job was to design an <span>online learning management system</span>
      that would serve as a platform for their new virtual course offerings.
      We hoped to build a website that could keep students engaged, build community among
      students, and connect entrepreneurs to mentors. The traditional in-person
      program had a strong emphasis on community, mentorship, and inclusion, and
      we hoped to translate that experience to the online platform.
